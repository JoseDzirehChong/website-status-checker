# About

This is a website status checker. Enter a website, and it will tell you if the website is up and running, if the domain exists but you can't access the website for some reason, or if it can't connect to the website.

Created by Jose Dzireh Chong.

The modules it uses are:

- `tkinter` (makes the interface)
- `requests` (connects to websites)
